"1","rn484801530","Lovely hotel. Rooms spacious and great views. Could use better lighting in bathrooms. great choice of restaurants within walking distance. very busy lobby that can get noisy at times. All in all would stay here again."
"2","rn484786638","This hotel was amazing! The views are superb! Walls of windows for your viewing pleasure. This building sores high into the sky, I roomed on 22.... giving you a view of Indianapolis from various angles. My room faced a baseball stadium, how cool?! And the State history Museum. I could also see a river walk and the airport.
The room..."
"3","rn484737934","I stayed for 4 night for National Convention. Everything right there. I stayed on upper floor overlooking the Capital building. Floor very quiet . Hotel extremely clean. I found the area where the conferance was very nice but no easy to get around. Even on the last day I found myself turned around when trying to find meeting room. Elevators..."
"4","rn484182648","My wife and I took our 2-and-a-half year old to Indy for a weekend trip, and this was a great place to stay. Literally the only knock I have wouldn't even be a knock on the hotel, but rather something to consider when you have kids. The pool isn't large at all, and not really made for families to hang..."
"5","rn483661135","Surprising that the City of Indianapolis allowed this monstrosity to be built. It stands out like a sore thumb, completely out of place with the architecture and flow of the city. While the staff was wonderful and helpful, the design of the public areas is atrocious. There is absolutely no comfortable chair in which to sit. All the sofas, seats..."
"6","rn483507330","I'm not a Marriott person as I deserted them 10 years ago because of couple issues with Marriott hotels in chicago. Well, I have to be fair and say this hotel is very nice, great rooms, great service. My only issue the parking is expensive. $45 per night is kind of high. This is Indy not Chicago or NYC.
The..."
"7","rn483230381","Maybe this hotel is great, but we never got to find out. We booked through a third party site (doesn't everyone these days?) months before arrival, and two hours before check-in we were advised our reservation was cancelled because they were overbooked. I don't know for sure, but it appears that first-comer-first-serve does not apply here. Someone paying a higher..."
"8","rn483221901","I travel extensively (150 to 170 room nights per year) on business and believe I am easy to please so I rarely post reviews. However both the JW Marriott and Downtown Marriott (they are both connected to the convention center) are horribly managed. When I arrived I was first in line to check in although the three clerks were occupied..."
"9","rn482756824","Nice place. Would recommend. Happy and friendly staff...even when making a slight error, they more than compensated, and truly seemed to have a sense of service. The place is very attractive, and the room we had was nice, spacious, clean and comfortable."
"10","rn482662837","Clean hotel with spacious rooms and high prices! Centrally located to all major attractions. Beautiful views from room 2406 but......cleaned room and didn't leave any shampoo etc after second day. No matter how low we put the thermostat on it stayed the same temperature. Obviously being controlled somewhere besides by the in room thermostat. Breakfast was to be served till..."
"11","rn482440147","As we agree, this is a beautiful hotel, and although the room was pretty and up to date, we had a few issues with our stay, and don't really feel it was with the amount we paid. To start, there aren't refrigerators in the room....More"
"12","rn481963785","No words can describe how awesome this hotel is. The view from the windows are unbelievable. The hotel has great meeting spaces that can accommodate many groups at a time. The bathrooms were kept very clean. Our rooms were cleaned extremely well daily. Great gym...More"
"13","rn481436053","Never a doubt by here, close to everything. Clean, comfortable, cozy, and accommodating. The entire place oozes world class from the restaurants, baRs, and conference center. Glad my company paid the tab and not me!"
"14","rn481100806","Check In: excellent, fast, easy and got an upgrade to the Concierge business floor
Room: Very well appointed with bathrobes and yes, a safe for your valuables in your room, all rooms should have this. Very good internet, included because I am a Mariott rewards...More"
"15","rn480758183","This hotel is very contemporary and very big. The view from some of the rooms is all you could ask for in Indianapolis. When I come back to Indianapolis again I'll stay here, and I highly recommend a stay here."
"16","rn478902916","I stayed on the 5th floor of the JW Marriott Indianapolis from 4/22-4/24 for a conference that was being held at the hotel. Check in was seamless. The rooms were clean. Two convenient bars on the lobby level. For the size of the hotel (large) you never seemed to have to wait for anything. They did a great job managing..."
"17","rn478834424","The skyways connect the hotels and parking garages with the rest the city. While I did not stay here I had the benefit of the staff and the hotel amenities by way of the conference. Very nice facility and more than capable of running several different conference schedules and groups at a time. They are highly organized!"
"18","rn478565051","Just an OK hotel. Stayed here for three nights and were not very happy with the service or the food.
Our king size bed was not very comfortable at all.
The toilet mad weird noise when flushed.
The food at Italian restaurant downstairs was not good. We had dinner there which was basically inedible. We ordered a kids size pizza..."
"19","rn478563054","Got a decent mid-week rate and was very impressed. Very comfortable, close to downtown, nice rooms. Service was excellent. Great value for price but I know price fluctuates a lot. I would definitely stay here again."
"20","rn478210836","Stayed here for one night for a conference. From the minute you walk into the door till the minute you walk out service is key. Easy new check in process with the mobile app to superfast check out with the mobile app. Accommodations for the conference were excellent, food was top notch, the bar staff were friendly and more than..."

Very nice hotel lobby and bar. I am here for the AAOE conference and service has been outstanding. Starbucks located on the second floor is a huge plus! There is..."
"22","rn477923345","This is a full service downtown hotel.
My ROOM was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. I had a corner room which had 2 sets of floor to ceiling windows allowing a lot of light into the room and a beautiful view of the city! There was a desk with chair as well as a large comfortable high back..."
"23","rn477753719","The JW is a great hotel within easy walking distance of downtown Indianapolis. The rooms are great and they have a ton of facilities. There is also a running trail that leads through Indy right to it if you're into that kind of thing."
"24","rn477753686","I was here with my company at a conference we hosted and this was a great hotel, so convenient to downtown. Starbucks in the lobby, how wonderful! It was a full service hotel, and you could walk to almost anywhere downtown through the skywalk which was great for a rainy night we had. Now my only complaint is the elevators,..."
"25","rn477556591","Stayed here while in town for a meeting at the convention center. The hotel is a full service upscale Marriott and includes multiple restaurants, lounges, Starbucks, etc.
It has a covered walkway to the convention center which is handy when the weather is uncooperative and a quick walk will get you there. It's also close to downtown restaurants, attractions, etc...."
"26","rn477116696","I had an awesome visit at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis. I stayed on the 33rd floor and the view was amazing. The concierge, and staff were excellent and met my every need. My room was clean and spacious and I enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel restaurants were fine and the food was great. I enjoyed the super..."
"27","rn476745109","Don't get me wrong, this is a great hotel especially for not a big city like Indianapolis. But there are two aspects I find not acceptable:
1) Service: overall is too cold. You don't have the perception to be treated as a customer, something special, but just like anybody else.
2) Restaurant: a hotel of such a size should consider..."
"28","rn475414846","Rooms are spacious and clean. Great views of the city and canal. Walking distance to Lucas Oil stadium, across the street from the minor league baseball stadium, museums and restaurants.
Nice well equipped gym and great conference facility. The meals at the conference were better than many restaurants. Well recommended."
"29","rn475399105","Just returned from a conference in Indianapolis and had the pleasure to stay at JW Marriott. There are other Marriott properties that are across the street and next door but this one is easily identifiable towering 33 stories of blue/black glass over Victory Baseball park, Indiana State Museum and White River park.
The hotel itself has fabulous accommodations, restaurant and..."
"30","rn475081150","I cannot say enough about the service we receive at the Indianapolis JW Marriott each time we stay. My wife and I stay here any time we are wanting a night away from the kids downtown and are always very happy. Five years ago we were engaged at the hotel and this year we celebrated our anniversary. When I mentioned..."
"31","rn475007030","We were attending a trade show at the attached convention center. We had reserved 6 rooms months earlier. Upon arrival, they showed that our reservation was for one night only. Wrong. This was a week long show and we had the confirmation showing the dates. After a long day of travel - and 10pm at night, they finally figured it..."
"32","rn474895828","Hotel is beautiful--rooms are great, quiet, big and clean. Staff are really nice and say hello when they are in the halls, etc. Attached to the convention center, which is great, although it is a walk. Food is good."
"33","rn474848581","I attended the Mideast Qualifier and reserved my room in November 2016. At that time, I took the time to personally request that my room come handicap accessible. After all, it was important to me that I have appropriate accommodations from my mother who has edema and congestive heart failure.
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Samantha who informed me..."
"34","rn474334790","Can't say enough about this place. From the moment I stepped into the facility until the moment I left was and am so impressed. They started with greeting me near the front door and stayed with me until the check in process was complete. Very comfortable beds and rooms exceptionally clean. I could not normally afford such a hotel, but..."
"35","rn474333652","The JW Marriott in Downtown Indy is conveniently linked to the convention center providing an easy walk back and forth, either indoors or outdoors. The king room that I stayed in was spacious, modern, and clean with a partial view of the baseball stadium. I worked late hours and was delighted that their room service was available until 1am and..."
"36","rn474331857","I love almost everything about this hotel. Great location with awesome restaurants. Staff is top notch. I am a platinum member and always enjoy the lounge for breakfast and a place to kick back and relax or to get some work done. Today, everyone in the lounge was complaining about how cold the temperature was. The thermostat is kept at..."
"37","rn474327331","helpful, courteous staff. walking to the convention center and adjoining businesses could be a little tricky but everyone was quick to point the right direction. rooms were quiet and bed was very comfortable. second time staying here during the NTEA Convention. this property is centrally located to the convention center and many surrounding restaurants."
"38","rn474225776","This is my third trip to Indianapolis and my third stay at the JW Marriott. The hotel is fantastic and the staff extremely helpful and accommodating. There is onsite, garage parking ($40/day). Getting into the hotel and checked in is speedy, the front is well staffed and ready to ensure that you have a comfortable stay. The hotel bar is..."
"39","rn474173318","The JW Marriott is a perfect choice for your stay in Indianapolis if you are looking for total comfort with subtle luxury. We enjoyed the zen that comes from a clean and perfectly ordered hotel room and bathroom and a good night's sleep on a comfortable mattress. Concierge level is pleasant with a diverse selection of beverages and enough food..."
"40","rn473694850","I have no complaints about the JW Marriott. I was greeted warmly, checked in quickly and my room was well apportioned and comfortable. Our Marriott reward status got me free internet. You are definitely paying for the hotels international flair. When my hostess found out I was Korean she greeted me in the appropriate culturally accepted fashion in Korean. It..."
"41","rn473376421","This is a beautiful hotel. It is definitely a step above most others. The lobby is modern, elegant and immaculate. The restaurant located in the lobby is also quite nice.

"42","rn472983546","Warmly greeted upon arriving, we found the staff to be pleasant during our stay. Our room was a standard double queen and I regret not asking if a single King was available. Our room was a rectangle where the beds consumed almost all of the space, there was a chair wedged in one corner. The bathroom would be a much..."
"43","rn472638625","I have Marriott Platinum status, and have stayed in Marriott properties across the world. This was my sixth or seventh stay at the Indianapolis JW Marriott. The first few stays were wonderful, and I especially appreciated the executive lounge. The last two or three times though have been really disappointing: no snacks other than yogurt in the afternoon, reduced offerings..."
"44","rn472512360","Very clean, staff was friendly and helpful. Drove in from I-70 and it was very easy to find. Parking garage is under the hotel. Elevated indoor walkway to the convention center, very nice in winter. Can walk to many exciting things from here. Rental cars and bicycles for touring downtown about a block away."
"45","rn472403430","WOW !!! WOW!!! WOW !!!

"46","rn471641416","This is definitely the best hotel to stay at in Downtown Indianapolis. We attended a volleyball tournament at the Convention Center and this hotel is connected to it via a glass walkway. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. The daily cleaning was immaculate. The bathrooms and products are very good. Loved that Starbucks is in the..."
"47","rn471631138","I haven't stayed at this hotel but I have been to many conferences and use the valet often. Nate Higdon and all of the valet team are incredible. Opening doors, removing an old coffee cup for me, asking if I know where I'm going, etc. My constructive feedback is that they absolutely need to add a way for customers to..."

"49","rn471226330","The JW Marriott is right in the heart of downtown Indy and convenient to everything. The hotel has many great restaurants/bars and the staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. I would definitely stay here again."
"50","rn471157527","I love the location and the service. However, it was very apparent our room had not been tended to in some time. There was dust on everything, and the frame of the mirror in the bathroom was coming apart/paint chipping. Seems like the rooms need a little TLC.
On some positive notes, the bedding was clean/comfy, view was extraordinary, and..."
"51","rn470959865","The opening drive up to the JW to leave my rental car and on to the front desk for check in was met with a very courteous attitude and willingness to help. The facilities were very clean, orderly, with a touch of ""feeling at home"" when I walked into the room People win the day and the bar area and..."
"52","rn470747845","With so many hotels (and Marriotts) all in the same area it seems silly to spend the extra to stay at the JW but it's a beautiful hotel with ALL the amenities from soft beds and bathrobes to fine dining or a great sports bar all under the same roof. Traveling to Indy for business (and getting in late), I..."
"53","rn470364473","We happened to be staying the night during the NCAA Basketball tourmament. The place was packed and games were on all of the numerous tvs in the lobby restaurant and bar. Room was nice and clean. We would return."
"54","rn470287802","This hotel is top notch. While I am not used to staying somewhere so fancy, the customer service was excellent. Everyone was polite, made sure they understood your needs and then worked quickly to meet them.

"55","rn469942890","Everything about our stay was great! The service was amazing from the front desk to housekeeping. We used the concierge several times and he was able to suggest good local restaurants and places of interest. This hotel is in walking distance of many attractions like Lucas Oil field.

"61","rn467163891","Super fast online check in. Very attentive staff. Beds are comfortable, linens are soft, but the pillows left a little to be desired--they flattened easily and I had to fluff them several times during the night. This hotel never disappoints and I highly recommend it for business or a personal stay."
"62","rn466903291","We were here for one night during the NFL Combine which was being held at the nearby convention center. We had no idea that Combine was in town when we made the reservation. Despite being full, our stay was very pleasant which is something that can only be achieved by a fine hotel. In particular, the young man who checked..."
"63","rn466750190","My wife and I had an enjoyable overnight stay at the JW Marriott. The high quality finishes, location, and customer service was second to none.

Staff fantastic
Hotel bar was good
Hotel restaurants staff was slow and food was sub standard
Amenities- pool, hot tub, gym. Clean and up to date. The bathrooms are nice and clean too.
I enjoyed the room but had plumbing issues.
JW brand is better than this experience and needs to raise the bar."

"78","rn459687811","Roomed on the 18th floor. Room was clean and well designed. Mattress was in great shape with good comfortable bedding. Easy check in BUT the parking deck was filled up so I decided to pay for the valet at 45.00 a night.

"83","rn457729416","This is a nice and new hotel in an excellent downtown location. I found the service to be quite good: both friendly and helpful. My room was spacious and looked good, in a Marriott kind of way.
One downside: The wifi signal in my upper floor room was weak.
But all in all, I would certainly return."
"84","rn457685181","Had a corner room with two walls of windows overlooking the city. Great view. Service was great. Location is wonderful.

"87","rn456452558","While the property was lovely, I was shocked to receive my bill at the end of my stay which included a whopping $45/day parking fee. This is Indianapolis, IN, after all, not NY or Chicago. I would definitely have chosen another hotel to stay in, had I known."

"92","rn455760426","Everything about the hotel was excellent - restaurants, service, room size and cleanliness, the location just across the street from museums and within easy walking distance to everything downtown.

First, it was a small portion, though the meatball was..."
"776","rn237911876","Exceptional facility by any standard. Traveled to a conference, which lasted four days. Comfortable, tastefully furnished room, with a wonderful view of downtown Indianapolis. The several on site restaurants were good, and reasonably priced. Fine dining, and shopping is within easy walking distance in downtown Indianapolis."
"777","rn237899281","This place is amazing. The rooms are super nice and very clean. The fitness center is spot on! And the food!! OMG!! Please please please try the brick chicken!! Thigh and leg in a Mole sauce over potatoes, asparagus, artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers from the BAR???!!!!!! Yes! My new number 1!!!"
"778","rn237879371","We were very, very impressed by this hotel. From a fantastic welcome, to a very luxurious room. This hotel has it all. We have stayed in hotels 3x the price, all over the world, but we were very happy to celebrate our anniversary in Indy! Great value!!! Great location centered in Indy, great food, very kind staff! We will be..."
"779","rn237869250","We stayed at the JW in Indy for one night in Oct 2014. I made the reservation in May 2014 and requested a King size bed. The hotel would not guarantee the room which was disappointing but seems to be a regular occurrence with Marriott that I have found. I hoped since I made the reservation 5 months ahead my..."
"780","rn237842294","We have stayed at many nice, high end hotels. This one is very impressive! It's beautiful, the staff is friendly and the service is outstanding! It's very comfortable here too. Even the details are thought out and top notch. Sheets are cozy smooth ( not scratchy ), pillows, mattress....all high end. The tissues are soft and so is the toilet..."
"781","rn237809581","We visited Indy with another couple for a weekend stay and Colts game. The hotel was very busy with check ins upon our arrival, but we were helped promptly. Our room was great and location was perfect. We walked around downtown in the evening and found dining and somewhere to have a few drinks. Then, walked to Lucas Oil Stadium..."
"782","rn237631451","If you are in Indy, the JW Marriott is the place to stay. Clean, extremely comfortable, excellent location, friendly, caring staff. Anything you would want is in the hotel. We checked in early and our rooms were ready. I requested a refrigerator and one was delivered within minutes. Every staff member we encountered had a smile and a greeting. The..."
"783","rn237586880","Well.... Had high hopes for this hotel, I do think the facility is stunning, however the experience was reduced by the staff to a regretful decision. I can honestly say that of all the hotels I have visited, I have never seen so many staff that are fake and only care about making money. They position staff around the facility..."
"784","rn237571129","Arrived and greeted by very friendly front desk clerk who upgraded us to free parking and passes to Executive Club! Room was gorgeous. .. Love the shower with several spray nozzles!!! Our new favorite hotel!"
"785","rn237436756","The JW is an exquisite facility. Staff courteous and rooms luxurious. I had a great time on a 2 day business trip but did not try any of the restaurants.
I like the self park even though it's a bit pricy for Indy ($33 per night). I felt my marriott elite status was respected with a corner room on the..."
"786","rn237021455","Beautiful property, clean rooms, excellent amenities and staff sets the bar for service. Really, every single person I encountered at the hotel was exceptionally friendly, knowledgeable and respectful."
"787","rn237008138","Our room was very clean and service was exceptional. We used the executive lounge services and enjoyed a full service breakfast, munchies through out the day, hors d'oeuvres in the evening, desserts into the night. Consider if in your budget. You truly feel pampered. I loved the fact that the conference I was attending was right in the hotel. I..."
"788","rn236845593","We stayed here for a conference. Service was impeccable and friendly. Room was great with a wonderful view of the city. Close walking distance to downtown and the zoo. Only complaint would be the parking - they share it with other hotels and by the time we arrived on Friday night only valet was available, which we never ever get...."
"789","rn236746640","Service was impeccable, rooms were very clean and spacious. My ONLY complaint is that the mattress was broken down on my side of the bed and was very uncomfortable and made for a very restless night. I have stayed at this hotel 4 times and usually the beds are very sumptuous. Love the hotel and will always return. The bar..."
"790","rn236720826","The hotel is only a few years old and everything is still crisp. Room was nicely appointed: lots of outlets, comfy bed, floor to ceiling windows and tastefully decorated. Hotel has a great location as it is near the convention center and downtown dining. If visiting downtown Indianapolis I suggest this hotel or the Conrad."
"791","rn236603470","I was in town for a conference/convention and had the pleasure of staying here. The hotel is gorgeous, modern and clean. I had a really comfortable room that was average sized but clean. Best part was that it was conveniently located next to the convention center. You could take the ramp and walk over or walk a block to the..."
"792","rn236601402","I've stayed in many Marriott hotels but this was the best experience of all. . The hotel has attractive rooms and public spaces but the service sets it apart. This level of professional, competent and friendly service says a lot about the management of this property. I would happily stay here again."
"793","rn236571738","The stay was great had a awesome room on the 28th floor very clean the only problem we had was the valet parking people was rude other then that had a great time lots of restaurants to choose from and it's really close to most attractions"
"794","rn236463559","I stayed in this hotel in conjunction with a large conference I was attending. The hotel was neat, clean, and accommodating, and the location was good. I experienced no problems with the room or anything else. The main thing I did not like was the price (around $200/night) and the fact that WiFi in the rooms was an additional charge,..."
"795","rn236426881","I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference. Great location in the heart of downtown. A mall nearby and there is a TGI Friday's attached to the hotel. All staff was eager to help. I would definitely stay here again whether on business or personal vacation"
"796","rn236271214","The hotel was fine, with some of the features you'd expect in a good city hotel, including a good-quality bed, a suitable large flat-screen TV, and an outstanding fitness center; among the best I've seen and used. The BIG ""however"" is the need to pay $17 per day for high-speed internet ($15 for low-speed). That is stunning for a hotel..."
"797","rn236257768","This was the official hotel for my son's and daughter-in-law's wedding. The hotel was perfect. Rooms were great, staff was competent and friendly, the rehearsal dinner went off perfectly, gym and pool were excellent, etc. Parking was expensive, but the state park right next door charges only $10/day."
"798","rn236210304","I just attended a conference at the JWMarriott and the service from the staff was so bad that I decided to leave the conference early. Also Indianapolis is difficult to navigate due to changing street names and the fact no one knows where anything is in their town. The cost of parking at this hotel for anything is outrageous!! I..."
"799","rn235869776","Stayed here for a work conference. Staff is immediately available to assist you as you enter the hotel. Rooms were nice, no fridge or microwave. Great views of downtown Indy (ask for downtown view).
Loved being able to access the conference center via skywalk. Starbucks conveniently located just before the skywalk.
Fitness center was one of the nicest I have..."
"800","rn235770389","This is a relatively new, pretty big hotel that stands out in the Indy skyline and looks well-designed and appealing on the outside and inside. The various views are probably as good as anywhere in the city. The lobby is a great social space. And it's a wonderful location if one is visiting the convention center, the football or baseball..."
"801","rn235625074","I betcha I have NEVER stayed at a hotel with such OUTSTANDING service and accommodations and I've been as far as Japan & Dubai. Didn't expect this level. Great model for nursing care delivery and my 50 class participants noted as well. Going to look for JW Marriott accommodates FIRST in future worldwide travel ventures. I am thanking and appreciating..."
"802","rn235595213","The hotel is quite new, rooms are lovely and spacious but the staff really makes this a welcoming place. Reception staff not busy at a counter greet patrons at the door or escorts new guest to the counter to register.
Location is excellent, with grand views of the city or the canal park, near convention center with covered skywalk for..."
"803","rn235552483","This hotel is so nice from the amazing staff to the beautiful hotel rooms. The views are amazing the security is top notch. I would stay here over and over again. I can't say enough about this hotel once you stay here no other hotel will meet up to your expectations."
"804","rn235455972","We traveled with our two small children for a wedding and had the pleasure of staying at the JW this past weekend. The hotel was jam packed, with every room sold out due to several events. Our small kids were beat from the long drive, and very squirmy at check in; the staff magically arrived to us with a treasure..."
"805","rn235438655","I am currently here on the APNA conference. I arrived last night, and was greeted by the kindest waiter Ricky and his manager Zachary Ashouri both were helpful with how to get around in Indianapolis. Unfortunately, when I got to my room I meet by a big bug that crawled out between my pillows. The front desk did quickly move..."
"806","rn235346530","Very nice accommodations, we had a 2 queen room. Staff was extremely helpful and attentive. Check in and out was a breeze. Lobby, eateries, and bars were all nice. Excellent location. We parked our car and were able to walk everywhere the whole time we were there."
"807","rn234777017","Happy knowledgable staff from the moment of arrival until departure.
A beautiful hotel with state of the art amenities and designs. 1st class all the way.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
Everything from the food to the business meeting rooms was top notch."
"808","rn234774116","Was at this property for a professional meeting. Not sure exactly what I was expecting but I was certainly not prepared by the level of attention to detail and service provided at this property. WOW! I am in awe. This team has been well coached. From the second I arrived to the second I left, I felt like every staff..."
"809","rn234561804","WOW! I had pretty much given up on Marriott's...never got the reservation right, charged for every little thing, tiny rooms without fridge, microwave which forces one to eat in the overpriced restaurants if tied close by. THIS HOTEL CHANGED ALL THAT! The Reservation was correct - 2 queens. The room was LARGE, okay no microwave or fridge but ice delivered..."
"810","rn234154058","Stayed for 4 nights in Sept 2014 for work trip. Beautiful room with great view. Number of pillows & quality was exceptional.

"812","rn234082586","Great environment, great breakfast, great rooms, great hospitality....what else. Love staying here. It is close to the central mall and restaurants. There is a sky walk as well. The buffet breakfast is great to start the day with, esp like their fresh waffles. I have always got good rooms here with a great view, and good level of courtesy."
"813","rn234008090","I just stayed at the JW Marriott for 3 nights while in Indy for a working business meeting. The hotel is very conveniently located. Convention Center and many restaurants are within walking distance; if the weather is bad, you can get to these places via the Sky Walk without going outside. When the weather is good, you can walk or..."
"814","rn233993576","If your travels take you to Indianapolis, this is where you want to stay. The hotel is still like new, having been built specifically for the 2012 Super Bowl.

"815","rn233964275","The JW was an outstanding place to stay ...great location, fabulous rooms and I can't say enough about the staff.
